## Howdy! I'm Medi.
This is my personal page for whatever programming I manage to get done.
* I'm a biomedical engineering  with a possible minor in Computer Science in the future.
* I was a programmer for my school's Python team from 2019-2021. Unfortunately, a lot of my work was submitted under someone else's name! Phooey.
* I have the most experience in Python, but I understand Java and am currently learning C++.
* Golang looks pretty neat. Might check it out at some point.
* I'm also an artist and composer. You can find my other works on most sites under the name "arrivemedi".
